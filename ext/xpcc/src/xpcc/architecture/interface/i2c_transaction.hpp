			 * NO! We want to keep the writeSize and readSize persistent, so that you do not need to
			 * reconfigure the adapter if nothing changed.
			 *
			 * So assume the following sequence with both writeSize and readSize non-zero:
			 * start - write - restart - read - ...
			 *
			 * During the first `starting()`, we check `writeSize != 0`, and request next operation `Write`.
			 * Then, during the next restart we will check `writeSize != 0`, but because it has not changed,
			 * we will never be able to enter the reading phase.
			 * We cannot check `readSize != 0` first either, because we encounter the same problem.

			 * Ok, so we use `isReading` here to signal, whether we want to write or read during `starting()`.
