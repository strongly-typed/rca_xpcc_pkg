/**

 * @defgroup	can		Controller Area Network (CAN)
 * @brief 		Interface to the CAN-Communication BUS.
 *
 * Controller–area network (CAN or CAN-bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed
 * to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other within
 * a vehicle without a host computer.
 *
 * CAN is a message based protocol, designed specifically for automotive
 * applications but now also used in other areas such as industrial automation
 * and medical equipment.
