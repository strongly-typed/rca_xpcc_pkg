/**
 * Wrapper to use any peripheral device that supports static
 * write() and read() as an IODevice.
 *
 * You have to decide what happens when the device buffer is full
 * and you cannot write to it at the moment.
 * There are two options:
 *  1. busy wait until the buffer is free, or
 *  2. discard the bytes that cannot be written.
 *
 * Option 1 has the advantage, that none of your data will be lost,
 * however, busy-waiting can take a long time and can mess up your
 * program timings.
 * There is also a **high risk of deadlock**, when writing to a
 * IODevice inside of an interrupt and then busy-waiting forever
 * because the IODevice requires interrupts itself to send out
 * the data.
 *
 * It is therefore highly recommended to use option 2, where surplus
 * data will be discarded.
 * You should increase the IODevice buffer size, if you experience
 * missing data from your connection.
 * This behavior is also deadlock safe when called from inside another
 * interrupt, and your program timing is minimally affected (essentially
 * only coping data into the buffer).
 *
 * There is no default template argument, so that you hopefully make
 * a concious decision and be aware of this behavior.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * // configure a UART
 * Uart0 uart;
 *
 * // wrap it into an IODevice
 * xpcc::IODeviceWrapper<Uart0, xpcc::IOBuffer::DiscardIfFull> device;
 *
 * // use this device to print a message
 * device.write("Hello");
 *
 * // or create a IOStream and use the stream to print something
 * xpcc::IOStream stream(device);
 * stream << " World!";
 * @endcode
 *
 * @ingroup		io
 * @tparam		Device		Peripheral which should be wrapped
 * @tparam		behavior	preferred behavior when the Device buffer is full
