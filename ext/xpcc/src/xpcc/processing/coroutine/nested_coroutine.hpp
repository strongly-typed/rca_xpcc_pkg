/**
 * Nested Coroutines protect against memory corruption by checking if the nesting level
 * is within the allocated nesting level depth.
 * If the allocated nesting level is exceeded, the coroutine does not execute, but returns
 * the `xpcc::co::NestingError` state value.
 * However, the `PT_CALL()` or `CO_CALL()` macros are not constructed to handle this error and
 * will interpret this error as a normal coroutine stop and therefore immediately continue program
 * execution.
 *
 * Since the required nesting depth of a nested coroutine can be known before runtime
 * by looking at the source code and counting the nesting levels, this check acts only as a
 * protection against executing random code, when entering too many levels.
 * So instead of the entire program crashing, the coroutine simply does not execute at all,
 * which can make it easier to track down the problem too few allocated nesting levels.
 *
 * You as a programmer are responible for allocating the correct amount of nesting levels!
 * However, if you are sure that you have counted the levels correctly and your code is
 * not breaking, you may remove this check from all coroutines in your `project.cfg`:
 *

/**
 * This is the base class which must be inherited from for using
 * nested coroutines in your class.
 *
 * You are responsible to choosing the right nesting depth!
 * This class will guard itself against calling another coroutine at too
 * deep a nesting level and inform you gently of this by returning
 * `xpcc::co::NestingError` from your called `coroutine()`.
 * It is then up to you to recognise this in your program design
 * and increase the nesting depth or rethink your code.
 * You may disable the check by setting `XPCC_COROUTINE_CHECK_NESTING_DEPTH`
 * to `false` in your project configuration.
 *
 * The coroutines of this class are mutually exclusive, so only one
 * coroutine of the same object can run at the same time. Even if you
 * call another coroutine, it will simply return `xpcc::co::WrongState`.
 * Using the `CO_CALL(coroutine())` macro, you can wait for these
 * coroutines to become available and then run them, so you usually do
 * not need to worry about those cases.
 *
 * You must begin each coroutine using `CO_BEGIN()`.
 * You may exit and return a value by using `CO_RETURN(value)` or
 * return the result of another coroutine using `CO_RETURN_CALL(coroutine())`.
 * This return value is wrapped in a `xpcc::co::Result<Type>` struct
 * and transparently returned by the `CO_CALL` macro so it can be used
 * to influence your program flow.
 * If the coroutine reaches `CO_END()` it will exit automatically,
 * with the result of `0` cast to the return type.
 * Should you wish to return a value at the end, you may use
 * `CO_END_RETURN(value)`.
 * You may also return the result of another coroutine using
 * `CO_END_RETURN_CALL(coroutine())`.
 *
 * @warning	**Coroutines are not thread-safe!** If two threads access the
 * 			same coroutine, you must use a Mutex to regulate access to it.
