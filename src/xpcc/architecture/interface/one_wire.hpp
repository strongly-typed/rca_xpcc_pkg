 *
 * 1-Wire is a device communications bus system designed by
 * Dallas Semiconductor Corp. that provides low-speed data, signaling and
 * power over a single signal.[1] 1-Wire is similar in concept to IÂ²C, but
 * with lower data rates and longer range. It is typically used to communicate
 * with small inexpensive devices such as digital thermometers and
 * weather instruments.
 *
 * One distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility to use only two
 * wires: data and ground. To accomplish this, 1-wire devices include an
 * 800 pF capacitor to store charge, and power the device during periods where
 * the data line is used for data.

 * ROM Commands

 * ROM command. These commands operate on the unique 64-bit ROM codes
 * of each slave device and allow the master to single out a specific
 * device if many are present on the 1-Wire bus.
 *
 * These commands also allow the master to determine how many and what
 * types of devices are present on the bus or if any device has
 * experienced an alarm condition.
 *
 * There are five ROM commands, and each command is 8 bits long.
